Hello, I am a student pursuing my `Master of Science in Computer Science degree from The University of Colorado at Boulder`.

My interest lies in working with data and building robust and optimized backend systems. I am also interested in ML/AI - especially Computer Vision.

I currently work as a `Graduate Research Assistant` at [Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/) where I am exploring the use of Computer Science to solve Environmental Science problems. I previously worked as a `Member of Technical Staff (Backend Engineer)` at [Vymo](https://vymo.com/) where I designed, built, and scaled data-intensive, distributed services. Since I owned these mission-critical services end-to-end I have executed all parts of an SDLC. I scaled some features by 25x, reduced infra costs by 18%, brought down error rates by manifold, and improved the performance of the service by 70% through a plethora of new projects and optimizations. I have also worked as a `Machine Learning Intern` at [Samsung](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b?cid=in_pd_ppc_google_im-all-all-all-dtc_sales_samsung-allproducts-all-2023_eshop-text-dsa_01jan2023-na_1ur-501336l-2024-eshop-bau-dsa-cpc_pfm--20857865252------x--&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcre4Pilo5mNGNTtpO7qP52qFN6uQPddzMO2xaMbkxpFcitDzCaDD_ooaAoHjEALw_wcB) with the on-device AI team, where I increased the accuracy of their Screenshot analysis computer vision models by 30% using data-centric AI approaches and built a data pipeline to streamline their data ETL processes.

During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by [Dr. Srinivas Katharguppe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinivas-katharguppe-phd-a192522/) in developing a deep learning solution to generate real-time music using human facial emotions. I worked as a `Research Assistant/Intern` at the `Center for Data Science & Machine Learning` under [Dr. Shylaja S S](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-shylaja-s-s-49b4091b/) to develop real-time image/video dehazing solutions. I also worked at the `Center for Cloud Computing & Big Data` under [Dr. Phalachandra HL](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phalachandra-hl-0408066/), where I developed better methods of monitoring devices in a network, using SNMP directly.
